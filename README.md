Raw results for the paper:

**Mislabeled examples detection viewed as probing machine learning models: concepts, survey and extensive benchmark** *Thomas George, Pierre Nodet, Alexis Bondu, Vincent Lemaire* https://openreview.net/forum?id=3YlOr7BHkx

These raw results come from the benchmark at https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/mislabeled-benchmark. The aim is to allow other researchers to benefit from the large random search that was run in these experiments, instead of having to run another hyperparameter search that would incur a large computation cost.
